# iFood Pro Browser Extension

## Description

iFood Pro is a browser extension designed to optimize and enhance the business experience on iFood, a popular Brazilian food delivery app. The extension provides tools to scrape restaurant pages on iFood, transform the extracted data into an independent website and menu, and generate a QR code pointing to the new website's URL.

## Core Features

1. **Web Scraper**: The extension will be able to scrape relevant data from iFood restaurant pages, such as https://www.ifood.com.br/delivery/belo-horizonte-mg/formula-pizzaria-castelo-castelo/5e0e7537-eaa7-49f9-838e-7205d80192e5. Information to be extracted includes:

    - Restaurant name
    - Menu items, descriptions, and prices
    - Restaurant hours
    - Contact information
    - Restaurant logo and images
    
2. **Website Generator**: With the scraped data, the extension will generate an independent website for the restaurant. The website will include:

    - A main landing page with restaurant information
    - A detailed menu page with item descriptions and prices
    - Contact and location pages
    - Styling and layout options for business owners to customize the appearance of their site

3. **QR Code Generator**: After generating the website, the extension will create a QR code that points to the URL of the new website. The QR code can be downloaded as an image for use in marketing materials.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The extension will be compatible with both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

2. **Performance**: The extension must perform the scraping, website generation, and QR code generation in a reasonable amount of time.

3. **Usability**: The extension should have an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily navigate and use its features.

4. **Security**: The extension will handle any user data securely, ensuring that sensitive data is not mishandled or exposed.

## Future Enhancements

- **Website Hosting**: Future iterations of the extension might include website hosting services, so the business owner doesn't need to seek a separate hosting solution.

- **Menu Editor**: An interactive interface where business owners can modify their menu items after the initial website generation.

- **Analytics Integration**: The extension could integrate with Google Analytics or similar services to provide business owners with visitor metrics and other valuable data.
